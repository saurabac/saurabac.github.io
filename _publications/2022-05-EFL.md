title: "Balancing privacy and access to smart meter data: an Energy Futures Lab briefing paper"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-05-EFL
excerpt: 'Digitalising the energy system is expected to be a vital component of achieving the UKâ€™s climate change targets. Smart meter data, in particular, is seen a key enabler of the transition to more dynamic, cost-effective, cost-reflective, and decarbonised electricity. However, access to this data faces a challenge due to consumer privacy concerns. This Briefing Paper investigates four key elements of smart meter data privacy: existing data protection regulations; the personal information embedded within smart meter data; consumer privacy concerns; and privacy-preserving techniques that could be incorporated alongside existing mechanisms to minimise or eliminate potential privacy infringements.'
