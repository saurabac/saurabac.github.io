abstract: 'We provide an exact expressions for the 1-Wasserstein distance between independent location-scale distributions. The expressions are represented using location and scale parameters and special functions such as the standard Gaussian CDF or the Gamma function. Specifically, we find that the 1-Wasserstein distance between independent univariate location-scale distributions is equivalent to the mean of a folded distribution within the same family whose underlying location and scale are equal to the difference of the locations and scales of the original distributions. A new linear upper bound on the 1-Wasserstein distance is presented and the asymptotic bounds of the 1-Wasserstein distance are detailed in the Gaussian case. The effect of differential privacy using the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms on the 1-Wasserstein distance is studied using the closed-form expressions and bounds.'
